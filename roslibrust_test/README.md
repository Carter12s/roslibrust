# roslibrust_test

Purpose of this crate is to provide some external tests for the roslibrust ecosystem.

Due to how codegen, the codegen macro, and main crate interact it is easier to stash some tests here.

Try to reserve this crate for larger scope integration tests, and prefer embedded unit tests in the other crates when possible.
